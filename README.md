# Hi there! 🤗

<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
I'm Thaís Araripe, a PhD Candidate in International Strategic Studies at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. I hold an MA from the same institution and a BA in International Relations from the Federal University of Santa Maria. Born and raised in Fortaleza, Brazil 🇧🇷, I've been living in Rio Grande do Sul since my undergrad studies. I'm a proud "Cearense" and a "Gaúcha" at heart.

<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">
☕ I'm passionate about applying Quantitative Methods using Python to International Relations and International Political Economy.
  
👨🏻‍🔬 I'm driven by curiosity to uncover how data can provide insightful information for political science research, and I'm eager to continually expand my knowledge.

📖 My current research focuses on BRICS as a case study for the internationalization of the Chinese RMB. I also have several works on China's Digital Currency, the e-CNY.

🎼 Besides my academic pursuits, I enjoy singing and music.
